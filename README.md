##  Resources

* [Using CSS Flexible Boxes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flexible_Box_Layout/Using_CSS_flexible_boxes)

    Thought it would be a good idea to include the article I chose to copy. :)

* [Canvas - Intro to jQuery & Basic Selectors](https://ufl.instructure.com/courses/330762/pages/intro-to-jquery-and-basic-selectors?module_item_id=6205798)

    I referenced this module to double-check my `$(document).ready()` function.

* [Canvas - Traversing the DOM](https://ufl.instructure.com/courses/330762/pages/traversing-the-dom-and-filtering-selections-and-manipulating-content?module_item_id=6205799)

    I used this page for a couple different reasons: to make sure the `.last()` method was the correct method I was looking for, and to make sure I was chaining methods correctly.

* [Canvas - Git](https://ufl.instructure.com/courses/330762/pages/git-tags-branches-merging-and-merge-conflicts?module_item_id=6205771)

    I haven't merged a branch in a while, so I reviewed this page.

* [Git - Tagging](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Tagging)

    This is my usual go-to reference when using tags and creating new branches based on tags.


## Deductions

_I reviewed the list of deductions for this project and in the syllabus._

## Comments

I am hoping you don't find any whitespace errors -- I am having an issue with my editor that's telling me the whitespace-package (in Atom's core packages) is likely preventing `insert_final_newline` and `trim_trailing_whitespace` from working reliably....

I didn't want to change any of my editor's settings without your approval so I manually configured the tabs/spacing of most of the HTML. However, with so much content copied over, it is likely that I missed some items.

Can you please give me some feedback as to how I should go about fixing this issue? Thanks!
